### FILTERING THROUGH QUERY PARAMS  

<br>

### keyword

> Used to filter based on the name of the product, uses regex to filter. <br><br>

Pretty much the search functionality of any application.

> API Call for searching through keyword => http://localhost:4000/api/v1/products?keyword= \<keyword>

<br>

### category

> Search based on a particular category. Note, there can be many products using a specific category, therefore search is done through regular string matching.<br><br>

In the frontend, this category shall be a dropdown or similar hardcoded selection fields.
